# 🐾 Universal WASM Compiler

**UWC** is a high-performance automated pipeline that compiles **C**, **C++**, and **C#** into WebAssembly (WASM) using GitHub Actions. It supports both "Standalone" binaries and "Full Output" (HTML/JS/WASM) for easy web integration!

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Fork or Clone** this repository.
2. **Add your code** to the appropriate source folder (see structure).
3. **Push to GitHub**. The `compilewasm.yml` action will trigger automatically.
4. **Download the Artifact**: Go to the "Actions" tab, click the latest run, and download `uwc-package.zip`.
5. **Run it**: Drag and drop the `.zip` file into the URL linked to this repo runner.

## 📂 Project Structure

The compiler is smart—it only builds the languages it finds. If a folder is empty, it skips that step to save time.

| Folder | Target Language | Required Files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src-c/` | C | `main.c` |
| `src-cpp/` | C++ | `main.cpp` |
| `src-csharp/` | C# | `*.csproj` and your `.cs` files |
| `dist/` | Output | (Generated by GitHub Actions) |

## 🛠 Compilation Details

* **C/C++**: Uses **Emscripten (emcc)**. Generates an HTML/JS wrapper by default to support standard libraries (`stdio.h`, `iostream`).
* **C#**: Uses **.NET WASM Tools**. Compiles your project into a browser-compatible WASM runtime.
* **Runner**: The `wwwroot/index.html` in the root acts as a "Virtual Machine." It uses **JSZip** to extract and execute your builds directly in the browser memory without a backend server.

## 🧪 Testing Locally

To test your logic before pushing:

1. Ensure you have `emsdk` installed for C/C++.
2. Run: `emcc src-cpp/main.cpp -o index.html`
3. For C#, use: `dotnet publish -c Release -r browser-wasm`
